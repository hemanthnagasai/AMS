## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to streamline the attendance-taking process in educational institutions. By utilizing advanced face detection and recognition algorithms, the system eliminates the need for manual roll calls, reducing time wastage and the potential for errors.

## Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition:**
  - Utilizes ANACONDA software for face detection and recognition.
  - Implements a pattern matching algorithm with a minimum score requirement for accurate face matching.

- **Automatic Attendance Management:**
  - Marks attendance automatically based on recognized faces.
  - Updates attendance records in an Excel sheet (.xlsx format).

- **Scalability and Integration:**
  - Designed for scalability with a prototype initially supporting 10 users.
  - Integrates seamlessly with other tools and systems, including Excel for attendance record management.

- **Vision Acquisition Subsystem:**
  - Captures continuous video feed from a camera for real-time attendance tracking.
  - Converts RGB images to grayscale for pattern matching.

- **Real-world Applications:**
  - Suitable for large-scale attendance management in educational institutions.
  - Explores potential applications in communication, biomedical fields, and automatic product inspection.

## Installation

To install and run the system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Attendance-Management-System`
